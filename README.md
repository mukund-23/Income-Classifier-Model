# Income-Classifier-Model
A binary income classification system
Problem Statement: A firm delivers subsidy to individuals based on their incomes. Accurate income data is hard to obtain. But it has obtained some authenticated data on individual incomes, demographic parameters, and a few financial parameters. The objective is to develop an income classifier system for individuals.
It also involves simplification of data by reducing number of variables to be studied, without sacrificing accuracy
The dataset consists of 12 independent variables and 1 dependent variable.
Algorithms used are :-
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors
